    <h2>Slow living</h2>
    <p style="margin-top:30px;">Slow living is a <strong>lifestyle</strong> that emphasises a slower approaches to aspects of everyday life.<br>
    It has been defined as movement or action at a relaxed or leisurely pace.<br>
    It began in Italy with the slow food movement, which emphasises traditional food production techniques in response to the emergence of fast food during the 1980s and 1990s.<br>
    <strong>Slow living also incorporates <u>slow money</u> and <u>slow cities</u></strong>.<br>
    Slow food and slow living are sometimes proposed as solutions to what the green movement sees as the consequences of materialistic and industrial lifestyles.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:30px;">One asserted benefit is that living at a fast pace can make people feel as though lives are chaotic while slowing down can mean that people can enjoy life more and be more conscious of sensory cues.<br>
    Slow living does not prevent the adoption of certain technologies such as mobile phones, Internet, and access to goods and services.
